**Do consciousnesses (implicitly) realise themselves?**
- [[Madhyamaka/Khedrup Je's Thousand Doses on consciousness not realising itself\|Khedrup Je's Thousand Doses on consciousness not realising itself]]

- Possible response from Jetsunpa (specifically to the [[Madhyamaka/Khedrup Je's Thousand Doses on consciousness not realising itself#^1b3691\|main consequence]] by Khedrup Je):
	- Despite the exalted wisdom of meditative equipoise implicitly realising itself upon explicitly realising its cognised-object (i.e. emptiness), emptiness would not become an [[Preliminaries/Collected Topics/Affirming negation\|../Preliminaries/Collected Topics/Affirming negation]] because of not fulfilling the definition of affirming negation; because its conveyed-object is not a [[Preliminaries/Collected Topics/Positively-qualified and Negatively-qualified phenomena#^275cf1\|positively-qualified phenomenon]]; because the exalted wisdom directly realising emptiness is an affirming negation.

**Summary:** 

*Therefore for Jetsunpa:*
- The eye-consciousness apprehending blue (implicitly) realises the eye-consciousness apprehending blue, but does not experience the eye-consciousness apprehending blue.
- This is based on the *Illumination of the Thought* saying: "When the non-conceptual exalted wisdom of meditative equipoise has established its cognised-object (i.e. dharmata), then through the force of that the exalted wisdom that is its object-possessor will be established;"
  དགོངས་པ་རབ་གསལ་ལས། མཉམ་གཞག་རྣམ་པར་མི་རྟོག་པའི་ཡེ་ཤེས་ཀྱིས་རང་གི་གཞལ་བྱ་ཆོས་ཉིད་གྲུབ་པ་ན། 
  དེའི་སྟོབས་ཀྱིས་ཡུལ་ཅན་གྱི་ཡེ་ཤེས་འགྲུབ་པ་ལ།
- If it experienced it, it would become a self-knower because then it would need to observe itself. 
- This is because *Illumination of the Thought* says: In terms of differentiating between observing and experiencing: apart from a few cases, there is no need to [differentiate them] in most cases.
  དམིགས་མྱོང་སོ་སོར་འབྱེད་པ་ནི་སྐབས་འགའ་ཞིག་མ་གཏོགས་པ་འདི་འདྲ་བ་མང་པོ་ཞིག་ལ་མི་དགོས་སོ།
	- Observing but not experiencing: The Buddha's exalted wisdom observed the suffering of the hell-realms but does not experience them.
	- Experiencing but not observing: The mental factor of pleasant feeling experiences pleasure but does not observe it.

**For other textbooks:**
- The eye-consciousness apprehending blue does not realise (explicitly or implicitly) the eye-consciousness apprehending blue because:
	- If non-conceptual exalted wisdom of meditative equipoise realises itself, then:
		- If it explicitly realised itself, it would possess dualistic appearances; and
		- If it implicitly realised itself, it's object would become an affirming negation.
- Therefore, since the first above passage says "will be established" (future tense), it does not mean that it implicitly realises itself but rather that it will be realised through the force of that, meaning:
	- Despite the aspect of that object not dawning to that awareness and superimpositions wrt that have not been eliminated at the time of that awareness, it eliminates superimpositions wrt that subsequently to it without relying upon another valid cognition.
