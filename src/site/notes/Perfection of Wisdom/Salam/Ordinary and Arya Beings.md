Etymology for "ordinary being" (སོ་སོ་སྐྱེས་བུ།): A being that takes birth through the power of their individual karma. (Not pervasive)

Mutually inclusive with "short sighted" (ཚུར་མཐོང་།): This side refers to samsara, the other side to nirvana; therefore: beings who only see samsara.

Meaning of "Arya being" (འཕགས་པ།): A being that has attained a true cessation.
