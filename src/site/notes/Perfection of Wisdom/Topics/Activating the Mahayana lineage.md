Leads to various discussions surrounding whether or not buddha-lineage pervades all sentient beings:
- [[Perfection of Wisdom/Topics/One final vehicle vs Three final vehicles\|One final vehicle vs Three final vehicles]]
- [[Perfection of Wisdom/Topics/Presentation of vehicles\|Presentation of vehicles]]
- [[Perfection of Wisdom/Topics/Where Hearers and Solitary Realisers enter the Mahayana path\|Where Hearers and Solitary Realisers enter the Mahayana path]] 
- [[Perfection of Wisdom/Topics/Analysing whether or not there is an end to Samsara\|Analysing whether or not there is an end to Samsara]]

Debates revolve around Hearers proceeding only to pacification (ཞི་བ་བགྲོད་པ་གཅིག་པུ་བའི་ཉན་ཐོས།):
- If sutras indicating those are literal then there are three final vehicles; otherwise one final vehicle
- If literal, they are an illustration of someone whose lineage is severed even prior to Nirvana without remainder (where it would be severed through the severing of the mental continuum)
- If that exists, then there are sentient beings who will not attain enlightenment; but even if not, is it the case that all sentient beings will attain enlightenment?
- If all sentient beings will attain enlightenment, does that mean samsara has an end?
