In terms of progression on the path, there are:
1. **Paths that are surpassed through abiding** གནས་ནས་འདའ་བའི་ལམ།
2. **Paths that are surpassed through seeing** བལྟས་ནས་འདའ་བའི་ལམ།
   Also: Paths that are surpassed through seeing and knowing ཤེས་མཐོང་གིས་བལྟས་ནས་འདའ་བའི་ལམ།

**Illustration of the first:** first nine bodhisattva grounds
The [[Perfection of Wisdom/Salam/Dharma Cloud\|tenth Bodhisattva ground]] is said to surpass the previous nine grounds through abiding, i.e. the Bodhisattva has attained the tenth ground having generated the previous grounds in their continuum.
*In short:* generated in continuum and then surpassed by the next stage.
*Mainly (no pervasion):* 
- Main object of meditation (སྒོམ་བྱ་གཙོ་བོ།) and actualised clear realisation (མངོན་དུ་བྱ་བའི་མངོན་རྟོགས།)
- Rigorous cultivation (ལྷུར་ལེན་གྱི་ཚུལ་གྱིས་སྒོམ་པ།)

**Illustration of the second:** Hearer's realisation of the 16 aspects
The [[Perfection of Wisdom/Topics/Surpassed and Surpassing Mahayana path of seeing\|surpassed Mahayana path of seeing]] (realisation of 16 aspects) is no longer rigorously cultivated (i.e. with great effort) in the way that the Hearers on the path of seeing cultivate it; therefore, it has been surpassed through seeing.
However, still generated in the continuum! *Not* seeing like an eye-consciousness observing forms 
(མིག་ཤེས་ཀྱིས་གཟུགས་ཤེས་པ་བཞིན་དུ་མ་ཡིན་པ།)
*Mainly (no pervasion):* opposites of the above.
