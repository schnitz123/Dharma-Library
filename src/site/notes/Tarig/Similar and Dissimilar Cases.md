མཐུན་དཔེར་བཟུང་བ། མཐུན་དཔེའི་མཚན་ཉིད།
**Definition of similar case:** That apprehended as a similar case.

If it is selfless, it is pervaded by being a similar case.

Dissimilar case has no definition because it is non-existent; because if it is an established base, it is pervaded by being a correct similar case.

Also referred to as:
- Property-possessor that is the similar case མཐུན་དཔེ་ཆོས་ཅན།
- Property-possessor that is the dissimilar case མི་མཐུན་དཔེ་ཆོས་ཅན།
