མཐུན་དཔེར་བཟུང་བ། མཐུན་དཔེའི་མཚན་ཉིད།
**Definition of similar case:** That held as a similar example.

If it is selfless, it is pervaded by being a similar example.

Dissimilar example has no definition because it is non-existent; because if it is an established base, it is pervaded by being a correct similar example.

Also referred to as:
- Property-possessor that is the similar example མཐུན་དཔེ་ཆོས་ཅན།
- Property-possessor that is the dissimilar example མི་མཐུན་དཔེ་ཆོས་ཅན།

Divisions:
- Direct example (དངོས་ཀྱི་དཔེ།): e.g. The subject - sound - it is impermanent because it is a product. For example, like a pot.
- Example proving through a different syllogism's mode of statement (སྦྱོར་བའི་འགོད་ཚུལ་གཞན་གྱིས་སྒྲུབ་པ་ལྟ་བུའི་དཔེ།): e.g. "The subject - the first moment of consciousness upon taking birth - it is preceded by the previous moment of consciousness that is its substantial cause because it is a consciousness. For example, today's consciousness." To prove the existence of past lives (which has no direct example).
- Neither: Establishing non-existence of external objects but existence of truly existent consciousness using the example "like a dream".
