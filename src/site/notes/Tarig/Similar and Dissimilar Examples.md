མཐུན་དཔེར་བཟུང་བ། མཐུན་དཔེའི་མཚན་ཉིད།
**Definition of similar case:** That held as a similar example.

If it is selfless, it is pervaded by being a similar example.

Dissimilar example has no definition because it is non-existent; because if it is an established base, it is pervaded by being a correct similar example.

Also referred to as:
- Property-possessor that is the similar example མཐུན་དཔེ་ཆོས་ཅན།
- Property-possessor that is the dissimilar example མི་མཐུན་དཔེ་ཆོས་ཅན།
