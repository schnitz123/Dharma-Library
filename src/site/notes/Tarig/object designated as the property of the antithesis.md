དེ་སྒྲུབ་ཀྱི་དགག་བྱའི་ཆོས་སུ་བཏགས་པའི་དོན་ཡིན་ན། དེ་སྒྲུབ་ཀྱི་དགག་བྱའི་ཆོས་ཡིན་པས་མ་ཁྱབ།
If it is that, it is not pervaded by being the property of the antithesis. (three possibilities)

རྟགས་ཡང་དག་གི་དགག་བྱའི་ཆོས་ཡིན་ན་མེད་པ་ཡིན་པས་ཁྱབ་པའི་ཕྱིར།
**Because:** If it is the property of the antithesis of a correct sign, it is pervaded by being a non-existent.

**Example 1: non-existence of the subsequent cogniser ascertaining meat-eater**
The existence of that subsequent cogniser is both; because that is a non-existent.
The meat-eater is designated as that but is not the property of the antithesis; because in general meat-eaters exist.

**Example 2: On a lake at night, there is no smoke because there is no fire.**
The existence of smoke there is both; because that is a non-existent.
Smoke is designated as that but is not the property of the antithesis; because in general smoke exists.
