**Divisions + Illustrations:**
1. [[Tarig/Correct result sign\|Correct result sign]] - *Smoke exists* (b/c correct sign + the predicate is its cause)
	1. Correct sign of result proving a direct cause - *Smoke exists* (b/c correct sign of result + proving existence of a direct cause)
	2. Correct sign of result proving a preceding cause - *Smoke* (b/c correct sign of result + proving preceding cause)
	3. Correct sign of result proving a general cause - *functioning thing* (for arising from c+c) (b/c correct sign of result + proving a general cause)
	4. Correct sign of result proving a specific cause - *functioning thing* (for possessing ooc) (b/c correct sign of result + proving a specific cause)
	5. Correct sign of result of extrapolating a causal property - *present existence of molasses* (b/c correct sign of result + proving a causal property)
2. [[Tarig/Correct nature sign\|Correct nature sign]] - *Product* (b/c correct sign + one nature with predicate)
	1. An attributed correct sign of nature in the proof of that - *arisen from exertion* (b/c correct sign of nature + implying an agent)
	2. An unattributed correct sign of nature in the proof of that - *functioning thing* (b/c correct sign of nature + not implying an agent)
3. [[Tarig/Correct non-observation sign\|Correct non-observation sign]] - *Non-existence of valid cogniser observing meat-eater* (b/c correct sign + negation)
	1. [[Tarig/Correct sign of non-observation of the non-appearing\|Correct sign of non-observation of the non-appearing]] - *same* (b/c correct sign of non-observation + suprasensory object)
		1. [[Tarig/Correct sign of non-observation of the non-appearing related object in the proof of that\|Correct sign of non-observation of the non-appearing related object in the proof of that]] - *same* (b/c correct sign of non-observation of the non-appearing + non-affirming negation)
			1. Correct sign of non-observation of a non-appearing cause - *same* (b/c correct sign of non-observation of the non-appearing related object + cause of subsequent cogniser)
			2. Correct sign of non-observation of a non-appearing pervader - *non-observation by valid cognition of existence of meat-eater* (b/c correct sign of non-observation of the non-appearing related object + pervader of being suitable to assert)
			3. Correct sign of non-observation of a non-appearing nature - *non-observation by valid cognition of that subsequent cogniser* (b/c correct sign of non-observation of the non-appearing related object + same nature as non-existence of that)
		2. [[Tarig/Correct sign of observation of the non-appearing contradictory object in the proof of that\|Correct sign of observation of the non-appearing contradictory object in the proof of that]] - *existence* (b/c correct sign of non-observation + either affirming negation or positive phenomenon)
	2. [[Tarig/Correct sign of non-observation of that suitable to appear\|Correct sign of non-observation of that suitable to appear]] - *product* (for sound not being permanent) (b/c correct sign of non-observation +  not suprasensory object)
		1. [[Tarig/Correct sign of non-observation of the related object that is suitable to appear\|Correct sign of non-observation of the related object that is suitable to appear]] - *non-existence of fire* (b/c correct sign of non-observation of that suitable to appear + non-affirming negation)
			1. Correct sign of non-observation of a cause that is suitable to appear - *same* (b/c correct sign of non-observation of the related object + fire is the cause of smoke)
			2. Correct sign of non-observation of a pervader that is suitable to appear - *non-existence of trees* (b/c correct sign of non-observation of the related object + trees pervade Ashoka trees)
			3. Correct sign of non-observation of a nature that is suitable to appear - *non-observation by valid cognition of vase* (b/c correct sign of non-observation of the related object + same nature as non-existence of vase)
			4. Correct sign of non-observation of a direct result that is suitable to appear - *non-existence of the direct result of smoke* (b/c correct sign of non-observation of the related object + immediately preceded by direct cause, i.e. fire)
		2. [[Tarig/Correct sign of observation of the contradictory object that is suitable to appear\|Correct sign of observation of the contradictory object that is suitable to appear]] - *product* (for sound not being permanent) (b/c correct sign of non-observation of that suitable to appear + either affirming negation or positive phenomenon)
			1. [[Tarig/Correct sign of observation of the contradictory object that is suitable to appear that relates via a non-simultaneous abiding contradiction\|Correct sign of observation of the contradictory object that is suitable to appear that relates via a non-simultaneous abiding contradiction]] - *the functioning thing that is pervasively covered with a great powerful fire* (b/c correct sign of observation of the contradictory object + contradictory with continuous coldness by way of not abiding simultaneously)
				1. Correct sign of observation of a nature contradictory with a nature - *same*
				2. Correct sign of observation of a nature contradictory with a cause - *same* (for goosebumps)
				3. Correct sign of observation of a nature contradictory with a pervader - *same* (for feeling of snow)
				4. Correct sign of observation of a result contradictory with a nature - *billowing smoke* (for coldness)
				5. Correct sign of observation of a result contradictory with a cause - *billowing smoke* (for goosebumps)
			2. [[Tarig/Correct sign of observation of the contradictory object that is suitable to appear that relates via a mutually negating contradiction\|Correct sign of observation of the contradictory object that is suitable to appear that relates via a mutually negating contradiction]] - *product* (for sound not being permanent) (b/c correct sign of observation of the contradictory object + not contradictory with permanent by way of not abiding simultaneously, because it is not a different substance from permanent)
