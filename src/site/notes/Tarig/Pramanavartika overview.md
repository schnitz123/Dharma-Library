3a: 4 - penultimate
- 3b: 4 - 12
	- "Of three types": 4-8
		- effect sign: 4abc
		- nature sign: 4cd
		- non-observation sign:
			- non-appearing: 5ab
			- suitable to appear
				- definition: 5cd
				- divisions: 6
				- dispelling debates: 7-8
	- "Just" (definite number): 9-12
		- succession: 9-10
			- collection of causes to proves the suitability of producing effect; therefore, not a 4th sign: 9
			- collection of causes cannot prove definite production of effect: 10
		- simultaneous: 11-12
- 3d (pseudo-signs): 13 - 16
	- incomplete collection of causes is not correct: 13
	- general effect to particular cause is not correct: 14
	- non-simultaneous different substances and not cause and effect is not correct: 15-16
- 3c (relationship of indispensability of the sign and predicate): 17 - penultimate
	- Refuting that the reverse pervasion is established through the mere non-observation of the sign in the discordant position: 17 - 24
		- Ācārya Dignāga did not assert that the reverse pervasion is established by the mere non-perception of the sign in the discordant class: 17
		- Refutation by means of six contradictions with scripture: 18-22
			- the words of Dignāga’s Gateway of Reasoning become defiled:
				- actual refutation: 18ab
				- dispelling objections: 18cd-19
			- stating that [signs] with remainder are mistaken would be incorrect: 20ab
			- those explained as merely possessing the reverse pervasion would be signs: 20c
			- doubts regarding the reverse pervasion would not eliminate [something] being a correct sign: 20d
			- a distinguishing feature, i.e. “object of hearing”, would be suitable as a sign: 21-22ab
			- the Ācārya’s refutation of the syllogisms of Vaiśeṣika would not be suitable: 22cd
		- direct perception that commonly refutes the Buddhists and Non-Buddhists who assert as such: 23
		- refutation of Non-Buddhists who assert as such by way of the internal contradictions of their assertions: 24
	- The proof that the ascertainment by valid cognition of the forward and reverse pervasions of a correct sign is taken to depend upon the ascertainment by valid cognition of the relationship of indispensability of the sign and predicate: 25 - 35
		- way of establishing the pervasion of positive signs in our own system: 25-30
			- establishment of the forward and reverse pervasions of correct effect and nature signs is established in dependence upon the relationship between the sign and predicate: 25
			- otherwise, consequence that the reverse pervasion is not established: 26
			- otherwise, consequence that the forward pervasion is not established: 27
			- dispelling of objections: 28-30
		- way of establishing the pervasion of the negation signs in our own system: 31-35
			- same as v25 but for non-observation of cause and pervader: 31ab
			- plus non-observation of nature: 31cd
			- non-observation signs = 3, but many by way of mode of statement: 32
			- summary of v17-25 (refuting, then est of pervasion depends on asc or relationship): 33
				- v17-24 summarised by: 33d
				- v25abc summarised by 33bc
				- v25cd summarised by 33a
			- summary of depending on relationship + absurdity of not: 34
				- v26 summarised by 34ab
				- v27 summarised by 34cd
			- are impermanent and product same substance? 35ab
			- 35cd???
	- Extensive indication of the valid cognitions that ascertain the relationship:
		- Positive signs:
			- Effect signs: 36 - 40
			- Nature signs: 41 - 198
				- Summary verse 41
				- Dispelling objections and presentation of other-exclusions 42 - 187
					- Brief indication 42 - 44
					- Extensive explanation 45 - 187
						- Extensive explanation the reasoning proving that terms and conceptual consciousnesses of positive phenomena are eliminative-engagers 45 - 186ab
							- reasoning undermining that terms and conceptual consciousnesses are collective-engagers 45 - 60
								- general explanation 45
								- dispelling objections 46 - 47ab
								- summary 47cd
								- fault of asserting as collective engagers 48ab
								- dispelling objections 48cd
								- summary 49
								- dispelling of objections regarding indicating that ascertaining consciousnesses are eliminative-engagers 50-51
								- established meaning of the previous explanations 52-53
								- refutations and dispelling of faults 54-60
							- To dispel the objection that the proponents of exclusion would have a similar fault through investigating whether terms and conceptual consciousnesses are one substance or different substances and then to explain the reasoning proving that terms and conceptual consciousnesses are eliminative-engagers 61 - 69
							- General presentation of other-exclusions 70 - 93
							- refute other systems of semantics and to explain the way terms are applied by way of other-exclusions that eliminate not-that 94 - 115ab
							- eliminate objections 115cd - 186ab
								- Dispelling the consequence that conceptual consciousnesses are mutually dependent 115cd - 123
								- Dispelling the consequence that expressive words are not pervaded by being eliminative object-possessors 124 - 130
								- Dispelling the consequence that if things are expressed by terms, then terms and later valid cognitions are purposeless 131 - 
									- Refuting Samkhya 165 - ???
										- The consequence of many causes would be purposeless 166cd - 176ab
											- Refutation 166cd - 167
											- Proof 168
											- Dispelling objections 169 - 176ab
										- The consequence of cause and effect being mixed-up 176cd - 180
										- The consequence of their applications being mixed-up 181 - 182
						- of negative phenomena 187abc
						- Summary 187cd
				- What are the syllogisms of correct nature sign possessing such a relationship? 188 - 195b
				- to extensively explain the valid cognitions that ascertain the relationship in correct effect signs 195c - 198
			- Summary of these two: 199
		- Negation signs:
			- non-appearing: 200 - 202b
			- suitable to appear: 202c - 206
		- Dispelling objections: 207 onwards
