དེ་སྒྲུབ་ཀྱི་མཐུན་ཕྱོགས་ཁོ་ན་ལ་འགོད་ཚུལ་དང་མཐུན་པར་ཡོད་པ་ཉིད་དུ་ཚད་མས་ངེས་པ་དེ། དེ་སྒྲུབ་ཀྱི་རྗེས་ཁྱབ་ཀྱི་མཚན་ཉིད།
**Definition of the forward pervasion in the proof of that:**
That ascertained by valid cognition as categorically existing, in accordance with the mode of statement, only in the similar class in the proof of that.

**Illustration:** product.
This definition is not definitive, because "sound" is also that.

**Definition of x being the forward pervasion in the proof of sound as impermanent:**
1. There exists a correct similar case possessing the sign and property in the proof of sound as impermanent by the sign of x;
2. x is related to impermanent; and
3. x is ascertained by valid cognition as categorically existing, in accordance with the mode of statement, only in the similar class in the proof of sound as impermanent.

**For x = product:**
1. Because vase is the correct similar case possessing the sign and property in the proof of sound as impermanent by the sign of product; because:
	1. Vase is apprehended as a similar case in the proof of that by the sign of product;
		1. Because the syllogism "Taking the subject - sound - it is impermanent because of being a product; just like a vase, for example." exists.
	2. There exists a correct opponent who, prior to ascertaining by valid cognition that product is pervaded by impermanence on the basis of sound, has ascertained by valid cognition that product is pervaded by impermanence on the basis of vase; because vase is an instance of product.
		1. Because a correct opponent in the proof of sound as impermanent exists. 
2. Because product and product are [[Collected Topics/Related as same nature\|related as same nature]];
3. Because:
	1. The mode of statement in the proof of that by the sign product is an "is" statement;
	2. The mode of proof is an "is" proof;
		1. Because the mode of proof in the proof of that by the sign product is either an "is" proof or an "exists" proof;
			1. Because product is set forth as a sign in the proof of that.
		2. It is not the latter.
	3. Product is impermanent;
	4. If it is a product, it is necessarily impermanent.
