དེ་སྒྲུབ་ཀྱི་མཐུན་ཕྱོགས་ཁོ་ན་ལ་འགོད་ཚུལ་དང་མཐུན་པར་ཡོད་པ་ཉིད་དུ་ཚད་མས་ངེས་པ་དེ། དེ་སྒྲུབ་ཀྱི་རྗེས་ཁྱབ་ཀྱི་མཚན་ཉིད།
**Definition of the forward pervasion in the proof of that:**
That ascertained by valid cognition as categorically existing, in accordance with the mode of statement, only in the similar class in the proof of that.

**Illustration:** product.
This definition is not definitive, because "sound" is also that.

**Definition of x being the forward pervasion in the proof that sound is impermanent:**
1. There exists a correct similar example possessing the sign and predicate in the proof that sound is impermanent using the sign "x";
2. x is related to impermanent; and
3. x is ascertained with valid cognition as categorically existing, in accordance with the mode of statement, only in the similar class in the proof that sound is impermanent.

**For x = product, those three follow:** དེར་ཐལ།
1. Because "pot" is a correct similar example possessing the sign and predicate in the proof that sound is impermanent using the sign "product"; because:
	1. Pot is taken as a similar example in the proof of that using the sign "product";
		1. Because the syllogism "The subject - sound - it is impermanent because of being a product; just like a pot, for example." exists.
	2. There exists a correct opponent who, prior to ascertaining with valid cognition that product is pervaded by impermanence on the basis of sound, has ascertained with valid cognition that product is pervaded by impermanence on the basis of pot; because pot is an instance of product.
		1. Because a correct opponent in the proof that sound is impermanent exists. 
2. Because product and product are [[Collected Topics/Related as same nature\|related as same nature]];
3. Because:
	1. The mode of statement in the proof of that using the sign "product" is an "is" statement;
	2. The mode of proof is an "is" proof;
		1. Because the mode of proof in the proof of that using the sign "product" is either an "is" proof or an "exists" proof;
			1. Because product is stated as a sign in the proof of that.
		2. It is not the latter.
	3. Product is impermanent;
	4. If it is a product, then it is necessarily impermanent.
