**There are five:**
1. Correct sign proving the meaning དོན་སྒྲུབ་ཀྱི་རྟགས་ཡང་དག
2. Correct sign proving the convention ཐ་སྙད་སྒྲུབ་ཀྱི་རྟགས་ཡང་དག
3. Correct sign proving only the meaning དོན་འབའ་ཞིག་སྒྲུབ་ཀྱི་རྟགས་ཡང་དག
4. Correct sign proving only the convention ཐ་སྙད་འབའ་ཞིག་སྒྲུབ་ཀྱི་རྟགས་ཡང་དག
5. Correct sign proving both convention and meaning དོན་དང་ཐ་སྙད་གཉིས་ཀ་སྒྲུབ་ཀྱི་རྟགས་ཡང་དག

**Definition of x being the first in the proof of that:**
1. x is a correct sign in the proof of that;
2. there is a possible common locus between:
	1. being that held as the explicit property of the probandum in the proof of that using the sign "x"; and
	2. being a definition.

**Definition of x being the second in the proof of that:**
1. x is a correct sign in the proof of that;
2. there is a possible common locus between:
	1. being that held as the explicit property of the probandum in the proof of that using the sign "x"; and
	2. being a definiendum.

**Definition of x being the third in the proof of that:**
1. x is a correct sign in the proof of that;
2. there is a possible common locus between:
	1. being that held as the explicit property of the probandum in the proof of that using the sign "x";
	2. being a definition; but
	3. no possible common locus between that and being a definiendum.

**Definition of x being the fourth in the proof of that:**
1. x is a correct sign in the proof of that;
2. there is a possible common locus between:
	1. being that held as the explicit property of the probandum in the proof of that using the sign "x";
	2. being a definiendum; but
	3. no possible common locus between that and being a definition.
