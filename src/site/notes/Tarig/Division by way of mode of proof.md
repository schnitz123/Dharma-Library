**Definition of x being the first in the proof of that:**
1. x is a correct sign in the proof of that;
2. there is a possible common locus between:
	1. being that apprehended as the explicit predicate in the proof of that by the sign x;
	2. being a definition.

**Definition of x being the second in the proof of that:**
1. x is a correct sign in the proof of that;
2. there is a possible common locus between:
	1. being that apprehended as the explicit predicate in the proof of that by the sign x;
	2. being a definiendum.

**Definition of x being the third in the proof of that:**
1. x is a correct sign in the proof of that;
2. there is a possible common locus between:
	1. being that apprehended as the explicit predicate in the proof of that by the sign x;
	2. being a definition; but
	3. no possible common locus between that and being a definiendum.

**Definition of x being the fourth in the proof of that:**
1. x is a correct sign in the proof of that;
2. there is a possible common locus between:
	1. being that apprehended as the explicit predicate in the proof of that by the sign x;
	2. being a definiendum; but
	3. no possible common locus between that and being a definition.

**Definition of x being the fifth in the proof of that:**
1. x is a correct sign in the proof of that;
