Here you can find over a thousand pages of my notes and translations on the topics of the major texts of the Gelug curriculum. Please use the left-hand toolbar to navigate them; they are ordered roughly in accordance with how they are studied in the monasteries.

It is still very much a work in progress (and probably forever will be). It started in the beginning of 2023 and over time I hope to continue adding other useful resources.

I am not super tech-savvy, so if you are and would like to help me improve the site somehow then please get in touch! Also, if there are any mistakes, typos, pages not working, etc. then please do let me know.
