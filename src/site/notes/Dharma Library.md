Here you can find over a thousand pages of my notes on the topics of the major texts of the Gelug curriculum. 

<p class="desktop-only">Please use the left-hand toolbar to navigate them or use the search in the upper toolbar. In addition, you can find my written translations of texts available for free and ways of supporting the Dharma Library also in the upper toolbar.</p>
<p class="mobile-only">Please use the menu button on the top-right to navigate them. In addition, you can find my written translations of texts available for free and ways of supporting the Dharma Library.</p>

It is still very much a work in progress (and probably forever will be). It started in the beginning of 2023 and over time I hope to continue adding other useful resources and translations.

If there are any mistakes, typos, pages not working, etc. then please do let me know.
