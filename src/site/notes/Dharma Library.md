<img src="/img/user/website/rabbit.png" alt="Profile" class="gyurme-pic"><br>Hi! Welcome to my Dharma Library! 

Here you can find over a thousand pages of my notes on the topics of the major texts of the Gelug curriculum. Please use the left-hand toolbar to navigate them; they are ordered roughly in accordance with how they are studied in the monasteries.

In addition, you can find my written translations of texts available for free (upper toolbar).

It is still very much a work in progress (and probably forever will be). It started in the beginning of 2023 and over time I hope to continue adding other useful resources and translations.

I am not super tech-savvy, so if you are and would like to help me improve the site somehow then please get in touch! Also, if there are any mistakes, typos, pages not working, etc. then please do let me know.
