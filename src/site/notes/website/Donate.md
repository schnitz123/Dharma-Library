The Dharma Library is the collection of my notes taken over the past few years as an aide to interpreting for the Masters Program; I am happy to have finally found a way to share them with others. In the written translations section, I hope to share some translations I have made and maybe fundraise to fund future translations (all for free distribution). 

In short, all donations go towards the expansion of the Dharma Library and production of translations (as well as any website running costs etc.); if you would like to donate at any time please use the widget on bottom right or click here (opens in new tab):

If you prefer, please contact me (shahartene108@gmail.com) to donate via bank transfer; I can provide local bank account details in GBP/EUR/USD etc.
