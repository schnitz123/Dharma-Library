<img src="profile.jpg" alt="Description" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0; width: 200px;">Hi! My name is Shahar Tene - born in Israel but grew up in London, UK.

I have an MSc in Physics (Reading), MA in Philosophy (King's College London), and did some postgrad studies at SOAS (London). On top of that, I have completed the FPMT's Basic Program and am currently vicariously studying the Masters Program. 
I am an FPMT registered teacher.

Since 2014 I gradually shifted my focus towards Tibetan Language, starting under the amazing tutelage of the late Bill Magee, continuing with the FPMT's Lotsawa Rinchen Translation Program (under superb guidance of Geshe Tenzin Wangdak), and currently working as the English language interpreter for the FPMT's Master Program in ILTK, Italy (under the loving whip of Geshe Jampa Gelek).

The Dharma Library is the collection of my notes taken over the past few years as an aide to interpreting for the MP; I am happy to have finally found a way to share them with others. In the written translations section, I hope to share some translations I have made and maybe fundraise to fund future translations (all for free distribution). In short, all donations go towards the expansion of the Dharma Library and production of translations (as well as any website running costs etc.); if you would like to donate:

I am not super tech-savvy, so if you are and would like to help me improve the site somehow then please get in touch! Also, if there are any mistakes, typos, pages not working, etc. then please do let me know.
