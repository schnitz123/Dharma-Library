<img src="/img/user/website/profile.jpg" alt="Profile" style="profile-pic">Hi! My name is Shahar Tene - born in Israel but grew up in London, UK.

I have an MSc in Physics (Reading), MA in Philosophy (King's College London), and did some postgrad studies at SOAS (London). On top of that, I have completed the FPMT's Basic Program and am currently vicariously studying the Masters Program. 
I am an FPMT registered teacher.

Since 2014 I gradually shifted my focus towards Tibetan Language, starting under the amazing tutelage of the late Bill Magee, continuing with the FPMT's Lotsawa Rinchen Zangpo Translation Program (under superb guidance of Geshe Tenzin Wangdak), and am currently working as the English interpreter for the FPMT's Master Program in ILTK, Italy (under the loving whip of Geshe Jampa Gelek).
