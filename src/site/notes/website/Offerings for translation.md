By Ācārya Tenzin Gyurmi

Fundraising Organiser: Thubten Chöying (Sarah Brooks)

**What is this book about?**
Rimé Geshe Tenzin Gyurmi is a distinguished teacher at the Institute of Buddhist Dialectics (IBD) in Dharamsala. Geshe Gyurmi took to heart the advice of His Holiness the Dalai Lama that the sutras and treatises should not just be something that sits on the shelf, but should be directly studied. After decades of studying Lama Tsongkhapa’s teachings, Geshe Gyurmi turned his focus to the original great Indian treatises as well. Originating from teaching notes on the Four Truths to IBD students, Geshe Gyurmi created this book that focuses on the perspectives of the Indian scholars in particular. This detailed presentation of the four truths from the perspective of the Madhyamaka-Svatantrika school also distinguishes fine points of differences from the Prasangika view, making it a very unique text. This highly-researched commentary can be used for deeply understanding the reasonings of the 16 aspects of the four truths as related to modern life, as well as to better understand the subtleties between the Svatantrika and Prasangika views.

**How did this project come about?**
During a week-long debate retreat with Dr. Atisha Mathur in Dharamsala, we started debating in depth on the 16 aspects of the Four Truths. Atisha-la was using this book to teach the class and challenge us with modern examples for debate. At one point Atisha-la said, “While it’s only in Tibetan now, someday this will be available in English…” and I had the strong wish for that to be true because I really wanted to read this book to understand more. I couldn’t find anything available in English that was similar to it and it felt like it would be beneficial to make it available for everyone who wants to learn about this fundamental teaching of the Buddha.

I’ve known Shahar for years and seen his intelligence, accuracy, and sincerity as a translator of Tibetan into English, and saw an opportunity to work with him to bring this precious book to a wider audience. Geshe Gyurmi kindly gave permission for us to do this and Atisha-la agreed to consult with Geshe Gyurmi on the translation to make sure it matches his intended meaning.

We all wish to make the Dharma freely available, so we plan to publish the final English book in a free digital format. 

**How much will the translation cost?**
We first want to emphasize that making an offering of even a euro means we are working together as a group to make this happen, which gives the project so much positive energy! This means offerings of any amount are beneficial. Shahar and I estimate it will be a minimum of 5,000 euros for translating and publishing this book, so we don’t expect to raise it all immediately, rather in stages as the project progresses. So far over 500 euros has been raised, so the translation has already begun. 

**How can I contribute?**
If possible, please contact [myself](mailto:sarahsuntara@gmail.com) or [Shahar](mailto:shahartene108@gmail.com) to make offerings via local bank transfer; we can provide bank account details in GBP/EUR/USD etc. (via Wise). This is usually free for the person sending, has better exchange rates, and incurs less fees.
Alternatively, offerings are more than welcome through Paypal, cards, etc., using the link below but please be aware that this often incurs fees:
