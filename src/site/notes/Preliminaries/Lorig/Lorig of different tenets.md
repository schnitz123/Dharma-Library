- [[Preliminaries/Tenets/Vaibhashika\|Vaibhashika]]
- [[Preliminaries/Tenets/Sautrantika-Svatantrika\|Sautrantika-Svatantrika]]
- [[Preliminaries/Tenets/Prasangika\|Prasangika]]

Asserting *four* direct valid cognisers:
- [[Preliminaries/Tenets/Sautrantika\|Sautrantika]]
- [[Preliminaries/Tenets/Cittamatra\|Cittamatra]]
- [[Preliminaries/Tenets/Yogacara-Svatantrika\|Yogacara-Svatantrika]]

Sautrantika assert that direct perceivers are pervaded by being unmistaken consciousnesses; whereas Cittamatra and Yogacara-Svatantrika do not, because sense direct perceivers in the continuum of ordinary beings are pervaded by being mistaken consciousnesses; because forms and so forth appear as externally established.

Sautrantika, Cittamatra, and Svatantrika assert that direct perceivers are pervaded by being non-conceptual; whereas Prasangika do not.

Prasangika's unique assertions:
- Definition of valid cogniser: A non-deceptive knower.
- Subsequent cognisers are pervaded by being valid cognisers.
- There are both conceptual and non-conceptual direct valid cognisers.
